# KaggleChallenge_Titanic

This is my attempt at the Titanic Kaggle Challenge - using R & RStudio. Analysis was completed exploring the methodologies of Logistic Regression, as well as Support Vector Machine. The metric used for overall performance comparison in this example was `F1-Score`, though the challenge specifically discusses `Accuracy`. My reasoning, as mentioned in the analysis is that while **Accuracy** looks at overall *True Positives* and *True Negatives* of all possible cases, the **F1-Score** does a better job looking at the incorrectly classified cases; this may be a better metric in this case, given the slight imbalance of class distribution within the Survived variable.
